                        <h2>For remote employees with broken hardware, IT pros get cameras rolling</h2>
                        <p>For IT departments fixing problems remotely, a tool that helps easily illuminate issues without confusing clients is the holy grail many help-desk teams are still searching for. But more often than not, the one they really need is right in front of their faces: the camera.

                            “Somebody’s calling in; sometimes they will express the problem, but they don’t know exactly what words to use, or how exactly to describe the problem,” Teddy Bekele, chief technology officer at Land O’Lakes, who encourages the use of video, FaceTime, Teams, and screen-sharing to help bridge any communication gap, told IT Brew.
                            
                            Good to see ya. Before the pandemic sent employees away from the office and into remote setups, a broken trackpad or screen meant an old-fashioned stroll to the IT desk. Live and in-person, a company techie could pop open the cover, do a few firmware updates, and begin troubleshooting.
                            
                            When an employee has busted hardware from home, the situation becomes much more complicated for someone like Jason LaPorte, CTO and CISO at Power Consulting, a managed service provider with clients both on-prem and remote. A broken trackpad can become difficult to confirm from afar.
                            
                            “You have to arrange a day so he can drop it off. Now he’s going to work without his laptop, or you’re going to send him a replacement, and maybe he’s in Michigan…So, now you have to configure that entire machine for his purposes. That’s hours of work potentially,” LaPorte told IT Brew..</p>
